## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    -   Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8 or higher.
    -   Gradle version 6.0 or higher.
    -   An OSGi runtime environment such as Apache Karaf.

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Water-Framework/OsgiTestBundle.git
    cd OsgiTestBundle
    ```

3.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    gradle clean build
    ```

    This command compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the modules into OSGi bundles.

4.  **Deploy the bundles:**

    -   Copy the generated OSGi bundles (located in the `build/libs` directory of each module) to the deploy directory of your OSGi runtime environment (e.g., Apache Karaf).
    -   Alternatively, you can use the Karaf shell to install the bundles:

        ```karaf
        osgi:install file:/path/to/your/bundle.jar
        osgi:start <bundle_id>
        ```

5.  **Module Usage:**

    -   **OsgiTestBundle-entity:** This module defines the `TestEntity` and related interfaces. It provides the data model and repository layer for interacting with `TestEntity` objects.

    To use this module, you would typically import the `TestEntityApi` service into your OSGi component and use it to manage `TestEntity` instances.  For example, if you are using Declarative Services (DS) in OSGi, you would declare a dependency on the `TestEntityApi` service in your component's XML descriptor.

        ```xml
        <reference interface="it.water.osgi.test.bundle.entity.TestEntityApi" name="testEntityApi" cardinality="1..1" policy="static" bind="setTestEntityApi" unbind="unsetTestEntityApi"/>
        ```

        Then, in your component class, you would inject the `TestEntityApi` service:

        ```java
        private TestEntityApi testEntityApi;

        public void setTestEntityApi(TestEntityApi testEntityApi) {
            this.testEntityApi = testEntityApi;
        }

        public void unsetTestEntityApi(TestEntityApi testEntityApi) {
            this.testEntityApi = null;
        }
        ```

        Now you can use the `testEntityApi` to perform CRUD operations on `TestEntity` objects.

    -   **OsgiTestBundle-service:** This module defines services related to resource validation and provides different implementations of a simple service interface.

    To use this module, you can import the desired service interfaces (e.g., `ResourceSystemApi`, `ServiceInterface`) into your OSGi component and use them to perform specific tasks. For instance, if you need to validate a `TestResource`, you can import the `ResourceSystemApi` service and call the `validateResource()` method.  Similar to the entity module, you can use Declarative Services (DS) to declare a dependency on the `ResourceSystemApi` service in your component's XML descriptor.

        ```xml
        <reference interface="it.water.implementation.osgi.test.bundle.ResourceSystemApi" name="resourceSystemApi" cardinality="1..1" policy="static" bind="setResourceSystemApi" unbind="unsetResourceSystemApi"/>
        ```

        Then, in your component class, you would inject the `ResourceSystemApi` service:

        ```java
        private ResourceSystemApi resourceSystemApi;

        public void setResourceSystemApi(ResourceSystemApi resourceSystemApi) {
            this.resourceSystemApi = resourceSystemApi;
        }

        public void unsetResourceSystemApi(ResourceSystemApi resourceSystemApi) {
            this.resourceSystemApi = null;
        }
        ```

        Now you can use the `resourceSystemApi` to validate `TestResource` objects.

## Functional Analysis

### 1. Main Responsibilities of the System

The OsgiTestBundle project is responsible for:

-   Defining a data model (`TestEntity`, `TestResource`) and related APIs for managing entities and resources within the "it.water" ecosystem.
-   Providing service interfaces and implementations for performing specific tasks, such as resource validation and generic service execution (`ServiceInterface`).
-   Demonstrating the integration of various technologies and frameworks within an OSGi environment.
-   Serving as a testing ground for the "it.water" framework components, ensuring their proper functionality and interoperability.
-   Creating reusable OSGi bundles that can be deployed and consumed by other components within the "it.water" ecosystem.

### 2. Problems the System Solves

The OsgiTestBundle project addresses the following problems:

-   **Lack of a concrete example:** It provides a practical example of building and testing OSGi bundles within the "it.water" ecosystem.
-   **Integration challenges:** It demonstrates how to integrate various technologies and frameworks (e.g., JPA, CDI, OSGi) into a cohesive system.
-   **Testing complexities:** It provides a testing strategy for OSGi bundles, including unit and integration tests.
-   **Modularity concerns:** It showcases the benefits of modular design using OSGi, promoting loose coupling and high cohesion.
-   **Reusability needs:**  It creates reusable OSGi bundles that can be easily deployed and consumed by other components.

### 3. Interaction of Modules and Components

The modules and components within the OsgiTestBundle project interact as follows:

-   The `OsgiTestBundle-entity` module defines the data model and provides a service API (`TestEntityApi`) for managing `TestEntity` objects. This API is implemented by `TestEntityServiceImpl`, which depends on `TestEntitySystemApi` for system-level operations. `TestEntitySystemApi` is implemented by `TestEntitySystemServiceImpl`, which uses `TestEntityRepository` for data access.
-   The `OsgiTestBundle-service` module defines services related to resource validation and provides different implementations of a simple service interface. `ResourceSystemApi` is implemented by `ResourceSystemApiImpl`, providing resource validation services. `ServiceInterface` is implemented by multiple classes, each providing a different implementation of the `doThing()` method.
-   The components interact through well-defined interfaces, promoting loose coupling and reusability. Dependency Injection (DI) is used extensively to manage dependencies between components.

### 4. User-Facing vs. System-Facing Functionalities

-   **User-Facing Functionalities:** The OsgiTestBundle project does not have direct user-facing functionalities in the traditional sense (e.g., UI, REST endpoints). Instead, it provides a set of services that can be consumed by other components or applications. These services can be considered "user-facing" from the perspective of other developers or systems that need to interact with the entities and resources defined in this project.
-   **System-Facing Functionalities:** The project includes system-facing functionalities such as:
    -   Data access and persistence using JPA and the Repository pattern.
    -   Service management and dependency injection using OSGi and CDI.
    -   Resource validation using the `ResourceSystemApi`.
    -   Testing and integration with OSGi runtime environments like Apache Karaf.

## Architectural Patterns and Design Principles Applied

-   **Modular Design:** The project is structured as OSGi bundles, adhering to modular design principles.  This allows for independent deployment, versioning, and reuse of components.
-   **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** OSGi promotes SOA by allowing components to expose services that can be consumed by other components.  The `TestEntityApi` and `ResourceSystemApi` are examples of services exposed by the bundles.
-   **Dependency Injection (DI):** Used extensively, especially in `TestEntityServiceImpl`, to manage dependencies.  This promotes loose coupling and testability.
-   **Loose Coupling:** Components interact through well-defined interfaces, reducing dependencies and promoting reusability.  The use of OSGi services enforces loose coupling between components.
-   **High Cohesion:** Each module and component has a clear and focused responsibility.  The `OsgiTestBundle-entity` module focuses on entity management, while the `OsgiTestBundle-service` module focuses on service implementations.
-   **Repository Pattern:** Used for data access in the `OsgiTestBundle-entity` module.  This provides an abstraction layer between the data model and the persistence layer.
-   **Provider Pattern:** Used to mark the interfaces as provider types with the annotation `@ProviderType`. This annotation is crucial for OSGi's service-oriented architecture, as it clearly defines the contract between service providers and consumers.
-   **Interceptor Pattern:** The "it.water.core" likely uses interceptors to apply cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, or validation.
